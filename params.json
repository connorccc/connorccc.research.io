{"name":"Behind the Scenes: What Powers Google?","tagline":"By: Connor Cook","body":"\r\n Google is one of the, if not, most popular Internet source people use today. It serves as a very convenient search engine that provides people with information right at their finger tips. Lets see what powers one of the most widely used search engines in the world. \r\n\r\n## Hardware\r\nBack when it was located in Stanford, the original hardware that Google used consisted of Sun Microsystems Ultra II with dual 200 Mhz processors. This was the main machine that was used for the \"Backrub\" project, which was the Ph.D project Larry Page and Sergey Brin worked on while attending Stanford University. They also used 2 x 300 MHzDual Pentium II serves, F50 IBM RS/6000, two additional boxes of hard drives attached to the Sun Ultra II, and a homemade disk box which contained 10 X 9GB SCSI hard disk drives. All of these things made it possible for Google to get up and running when it was first created. \r\n\r\n## Servers\r\n\r\nGoogles servers are grouped into separate categories. Web servers coordinate the follow through of queries sent by users, then create the results into an HTML page. Data-gathering servers are predominantly dedicated to web indexing, which updates the document databases. The document servers store documents, like when someone searches for a certain document, a server returns a reply for the document based on query words. Ad servers manage advertisements offered by other services, and spelling servers make recommendations on how to spell certain queries. All of these servers provide the services that Google is known and used for. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nInside this campus network center, routers and switches allow the data centers to communicate with one another. The fiber optic network connecting these sites work up to speeds that are more than 200,000 times faster than a typical household internet connection. This is what allows Google to offer instantaneous results to their users.![Web Servers](https://ititch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/google-mail.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nGoogle works with other companies and has many contributors for their security. Some companies and contributors consist of Avnet Information Security Specialists. Avnet is a consulting firm that secures databases to prevent from internal and external theft. Another company is IBM Rational Application Security, which protects against the threat of attacks and data breaches.\r\n\r\n### Sources\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_platform\r\nhttp://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/category/application-security\r\nhttp://www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/#/\r\nhttp://www.avnet.co.il/\r\n   \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
